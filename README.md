# Portfolio Project v2

Because this project was required for a course I did, not all of the technologies used are up to date.

And also the "projects" section contains mock projects, they are there just for the sake of UI showcase.

## Tools used

- React.js
- create-react-app (framework)
- Chakra-UI (components)
- Formik & Yup (form validation)

## Some Features

- Dynamic header that hides itself when scrolling down
- Controlled form that mimics a call to an API
